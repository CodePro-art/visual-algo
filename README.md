# React: Week Project - Visualize Algorithms

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Table of Contents:

---
### `Motivation:`

Many students struggle to efficiently learn and remember new algorithms and apply them in their code. Visualizing data structures and algorithms through animation improves the learning process and sometimes simplifies the idea behind the code without even having the need to read code. 

---
### `Features:`

<ins>Searching and selecting:</ins>
* Search and/or choose the wanted algorithm.

<ins>Handle data:</ins>
* Menually insert data as input for the selected algorithm.
* Alternatively, choose automated mode for random input.

<ins>Learn how it works:</ins>
* Select algorithm speed.
* Enjoy the animated visuallization of the selected algorithm.
* You can:
  * pause
  * start/continue
  * reset
  * skip to end
  * slow-down/speed-up
* Watch the code lines in real time.

<ins>Read implementaion:</ins>
  * C++
  * JS
  * Python

### `Time Management:`
#### `Must have:`
* At leat 3 algorithm animations.
* Automated/menual data insertion.
* Codes in 3 languages: 
  * C++
  * JavaScript
  * Python
#### `Nice to have:`
* Tracking option ("Debug").
* Controlling the algorithm speed.
#### `Maybe in the future:`
* Social forum for signed in participants.
* Enable open source community.
